# BunnyDroid üê∞

>tl;dr: A text-based deep link access tool on Android: directly launch supported pages inside apps. This repo accepts contributions to new commands.

The moniker BunnyDroid takes inspiration from a tech giant's search tool but for Android! BunyDroid let's you directly open pages inside apps without having to follow the traditional path of navigation. With just a characters, you can "hop" (hence the bunny reference) to the screen of your choice inside supported apps.

## Background

The motivation is for the shortcut-fanatics to be able to launch specific pages inside apps without having to _"launch-click-click-click-...-page"_. While that may sound like an exaggeration, BunnyDroid for Android will grow on you as you start using it.

Try `azo` to jump to your Amazon orders or `ym yellow` to listen to Coldplay's Yellow on YT Music all without having to hunt for these apps on your app drawer! 

## Setup

Head over to the [releases section](https://github.com/theGeekyLad/bunny-droid/releases) and grab the latest release. Just download and install _(use `adb` if you're feeling like a pro)_.

## Commands

Here's an exhaustive unsorted list of all supported commands:

## Contributing

Let's consider an example of extending support to **Google search** with the command `g <QUERY>`:

1. Clone the `com/thegeekylad/bunnydroid/data/CommandExample.kt` template and call it `CommandGSearch.kt`.
2. Make relevant changes to the code to support search with and without arguments _(refer to the real `CommandGSearch.kt` to see how it's implemented)_.
3. Create a new entry in `com/thegeekylad/bunnydroid/di/CommandModule.kt` for DI like this:
```Kotlin
@Provides
@IntoMap
@StringKey("g")
fun commandGSearch(): ICommand = CommandGSearch()
```
4. Add an entry in the `README.md` to help users discover your command
5. Save, commit, and create a PR.

Overall, you only change two files. Thanks for helping BunnyDroid grow!
